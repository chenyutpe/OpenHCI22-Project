# Campus Chicken Crisis: Betting Half of the Future (校園危雞｜賭上未來的二分之一)

Currently, there is a problem of misclassification in the waste sorting facilities on campus, mainly due to students' lack of knowledge about whether the waste is recyclable or not, despite having environmental awareness. Through the "Campus Chicken Crisis" timed campus tour, students from various schools are encouraged to correctly sort their waste to earn points, and promote correct environmental knowledge on campus.
